It’s a positive sign if both people have the same
type of hands. For instance, Fire and Fire are a good match since they
have similar temperaments.
It’s not quite as easy if the hand shapes are different. Fire and Earth do
not relate well, as fire scorches earth. Fire and Air get on famously, as
air fans and stimulates fire. Fire and Water are not compatible, as
water puts out the fire. Earth and Air get on well, as air allows living
things to grow and flourish in earth. Earth and Water also get along
well, as water enables life to exist on earth. Air and Water would have
a placid, unexciting relationship as both are necessary for survival, but
do little for each other.
